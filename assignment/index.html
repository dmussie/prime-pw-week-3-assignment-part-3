      <li>I could use additional practices with "while loops": are there instances where "while loops" are more preferred as opposed to "for loops"?</li>
      <li>If an array was a mix of numbers and words, would we need to put all items in single quotes '' ?</li>
      <li>Is there a preferred notation for references items in an array in a loop? I write 'i' so I can think of 'index' but I've seen different notation from others</li>
    </ol>
